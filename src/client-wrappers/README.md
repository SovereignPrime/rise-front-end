This directory contains client API wrappers to be used from within the front-end application.

Source (.ts) files and suporting build files (like tsconfig.json and .d.ts decl files) are
present here.

Build and run instructions are not included here since these files are not meant to be run
as part of this repository. Instead, they will be imported into rise-front-end github repo
and integrated into the React app there.
